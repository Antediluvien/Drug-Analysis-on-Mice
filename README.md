Hypothesis:
-
What is the efficacy of the drugs Capomulin, Ketapril, Infubinol, regarding tumor growth mitigation, number of metastatic sites and survivability rate of the subjects (mice) compared to the utilization of placebos?

Thought process:
-
How do I make the process of comparing the efficacy of these drugs as easy as possible?  From here I thought that visualizing the data to see how all the externalities of drug usage compare to each other via graphs to see how the mice react to the drugs.  From there I isolated each of the reaction types to the drugs and graphed them so that I can visually see which of the drugs was best to use.
